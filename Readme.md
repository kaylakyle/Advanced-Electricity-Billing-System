How It Works

Login & OTP Verification
Users log in with their credentials, then verify via a 6-digit OTP.

Customer Management
Admin or staff adds customer details (name, meter number).

Billing Generation
Staff generates bills with readings, units, and amounts. Previous readings are automatically carried over.

Payments Recording
Payments are linked to bills and automatically update paid/pending status.

Reporting & Analytics
The system calculates KPIs, top consumers, and detailed reports based on all recorded bills and payments.

Activity Tracking & Reset
All system actions are logged for transparency. Reset option allows starting fresh when needed.

How to Run the System

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/kaylakyle/ElectroFlow.git


Open the login.html in a browser.

Log in using any role, verify OTP, and navigate through the dashboard.

Use the sidebar to access Customers, Billing, Payments, and Reports pages.

All data is stored locally in the browser; clearing localStorage resets the system.

Future Improvements with Java Integration

Integrating Java (backend) can significantly enhance the system by:

Persistent Database Storage

Use MySQL or PostgreSQL to store customers, bills, and payments permanently.

Eliminates dependency on browser localStorage.

Server-Side Authentication

Implement secure login and OTP verification with hashed passwords.

Role-based access control (Admin, Staff, Customer).

Automated Billing & Scheduling

Use Java to generate recurring monthly bills automatically.

Integrate scheduled jobs (e.g., via Spring Boot or Java Timer) for alerts and reminders.

REST API

Expose endpoints for frontend to fetch/update data.

Makes the system scalable for mobile apps or multiple frontend interfaces.

Enhanced Reporting

Use Java libraries (e.g., JasperReports) for PDF reports.

Generate charts dynamically using backend data.

Security & Logging

Implement audit logs and error handling on the server-side.

Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

Notes

The current version uses localStorage, so data is browser-specific.

Future Java backend will allow multi-user access, database persistence, and secure authentication.

All exported reports (PDF/CSV) are generated client-side with jsPDF & FileSaver.js.
